//
// Note: syntax is very important.  The line should start with
// the slash comments, a single space, and the word Resource followed
// by a colon to ID a resource.  Anything after the colon is the resource
// path.
//
// Note: Do not use '-' character in path or file names. Use '_' instead.

// Common resources
// Local:resources/client.cer
// Local:resources/privkey.cer
