This is a WICED Studio project that acts as the central game controller to test the remote control BLE functionality. It goes on a PSoC 6 062 Pioneer WiFi-BT kit (1M).

It will allow 2 connections from remotes. It updates the levelLeft and levelRight values using a timer. It updates each one every alternate 2 seconds.

Pump values from the remote will be displayed on the UART.
